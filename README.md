# The-50-states-quiz

## Introduction

### This is a python game that quizzes the users on their knowledge of US- Staes names.It is maed using python and the tkinter module. It has a file called "50-states.csv" where all the data is stored and I have used some very basic commands from the pandas library to make the game.

## Features

### It is extremely easy to play. If the name guesssed is correct then the name of the state is shown on top of its location on the map. The wrong guesses do not do anything. The games end when all states have been named or the user types exit in the dialog box. After the game is finished the remaining states are all written down in the states left file. So you can just look at it to improve your knowledge
